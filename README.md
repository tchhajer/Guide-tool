# Guide Tool for Busbar Alignment in Lithium-Ion Battery Cabinets

## Overview
The Guide Tool project addresses a critical assembly challenge encountered during the production of lithium-ion battery cabinets at Vertiv. It was developed as a precision alignment fixture to assist in the accurate placement of busbarsâ€”an essential component in battery modules. Misalignment had previously led to a 10% defect rate, along with costly rework and workflow inefficiencies.

## Objective
To eliminate misalignment issues in busbar installation by designing a reliable, ergonomic, and production-friendly guide tool using rapid prototyping methods.

## Problem Statement
Before this tool, the assembly line struggled with:
- **10% defect rate** in busbar alignment
- Frequent **rework and scrap**
- Operator frustration and decreased efficiency
- Variability introduced by manual alignment methods

## Design Process

### Step 1: Requirements Gathering
- Conducted interviews with assembly operators to identify usability challenges
- Analyzed alignment deviation patterns
- Measured busbar geometry and cabinet interface

### Step 2: Rapid Prototyping
Three design iterations were developed and tested:
1. **Prototype 1** â€“ Correctly shaped but lacked proper tolerancing, resulting in loose fits.
2. **Prototype 2** â€“ Addressed fit but failed under stress and lacked ergonomic usability.
3. **Prototype 3** â€“ Final version with improved strength, correct alignment clearance, and better grip. Fabricated in black PLA and field-tested successfully.

### Step 3: Testing & Validation
- Tool tested in a production environment
- Achieved **0% alignment defects** post-implementation
- Fully adopted into the process after feedback from the production floor

## Outcome
- Reduced alignment-related defects from **10% to 0%**
- Eliminated need for rework
- Enhanced production throughput
- Increased operator satisfaction
- Minimal implementation cost due to 3D printing

## Technology Stack
- CAD: SolidWorks
- Fabrication: FDM 3D Printing using PLA
- Collaboration: On-site interviews, rapid iterations, shop floor testing

## Impact
The tool proved to be an inexpensive yet high-impact solution. It demonstrates how **user-driven design** and **rapid prototyping** can enhance manufacturing reliability and reduce costs significantly.
