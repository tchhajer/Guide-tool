# Guide Tool for Busbar Alignment in Lithium-Ion Battery Cabinets

## Overview

This project showcases the development of a precision alignment tool designed to assist in the assembly of busbars within lithium-ion battery cabinets at Vertiv. The guide tool aimed to address critical quality issues caused by misalignment during manual assembly and was developed through a process of rapid prototyping, user feedback, and ergonomic refinement.

## Problem Statement

Manual alignment of copper busbars in lithium-ion battery cabinets was resulting in:
- A 10% defect rate due to misalignment
- Frequent rework and delays in production
- Operator strain and inefficiencies in workflow

Given the high importance of precision and repeatability in electrical cabinet assembly, a tooling solution was needed to ensure consistency, minimize rework, and enhance process reliability.

## Solution

A 3D-printed alignment tool was developed using CREO Parametric and manufactured in-house using additive manufacturing. The design incorporated:
- Guide slots precisely matched to busbar geometry
- Operator-friendly grips for stability
- Lightweight construction and ergonomic considerations
- Magnetic anchoring system for ease of use in confined spaces

## Key Features

- âœ… **Defect Reduction**: Quality issues from misalignment dropped from 10% to 0%
- ðŸ’¡ **User-Driven Design**: Iteratively refined based on technician feedback
- ðŸ”§ **Ergonomic & Lightweight**: Minimizes fatigue and facilitates single-person use
- ðŸ§ª **Cost-Effective Prototyping**: Fabricated through 3D printing for fast iteration
- ðŸ’¸ **ROI**: Reduced costs associated with scrap, rework, and production downtime

## Impact

- Improved workflow efficiency on the battery cabinet assembly line
- Reduced reliance on skilled manual alignment
- Documented savings in labor hours and defect-related scrap
- Reinforced culture of continuous improvement through Lean practices

## Tools & Technologies

- **CAD Modeling**: PTC Creo Parametric
- **Manufacturing**: FDM 3D Printing
- **Design Approach**: Rapid prototyping, user-centered design
- **Analysis**: Manual fit testing and operator validation
